# horses-or-humans_CNN
This is my laboratory work from DeepLearning.AI course "Introduction to TensorFlow for Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning".

The aim of this work is to create convolutional neural network to classify Horses or Humans.


Images in dataset look like this:
